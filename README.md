## Installation instructions 
1. Install [browser add-on](#addon "browser add-on")
2. Copy the [CSS code from this Git](https://github.com/tomwatney/AV-Dark-Theme/blob/master/av-v7-dark-theme.css "CSS code from this Git") into the settings of your browser add-on
3. Define the URLs/domains it should be applied to

This was designed to work with the default theme (Contrasting Thoughts - purple and orange), but does work with the other themes.
